# The Bitcoin Hole - Inheritance Services

## Introduction

Unlike traditional assets such as real estate or stocks, bitcoin is often stored in digital wallets, accessible only through private keys or passwords. Without proper planning, the sudden loss of these keys can result in the permanent loss of significant wealth for heirs.

Bitcoin inheritance services offer a solution to this problem by providing individuals with the tools and strategies to securely pass on their bitcoin holdings to beneficiaries. These services typically include features such as multi-signature wallets, secure storage solutions, and detailed instructions for heirs on how to access the assets in the event of the owner's death or incapacitation.

## Collaboration

Inside the `items` directory, there is a JSON file for each item, with all the data about it. To collaborate (adding missing data, fixing wrong data or adding a new item), just fork the repository and send a pull request with the changes.

Before sending the pull request, please run the following commands to format the JSON:

```
cd scripts/
node json-format.js
```

## JSON format

The following is a sample of the JSON format:

```json
{
    "id": "inheritance-service-id",
    "name": "Inheritance Service Name",
    "category-name": {
      "feature-name-1": {
        "value": "YES", 
        "flag": "positive",
        "supported": true,
        "texts": [
          "Optional contextual text describing the feature"
        ],
        "links": [
          {
            "title": "Optional contextual link referencing official documentation",
            "url": "url"
          }
        ]
      },
      "feature-name-2": {
        "value": "Experimental",
        "flag": "neutral",
        "supported": true
      },
      "feature-name-3": {
        "value": "NO",
        "flag": "negative",
        "supported": false
      }
    }
}
```
